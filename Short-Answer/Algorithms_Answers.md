#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n)


b) O(n log n)


c) O(n)

## Exercise II

Loop through all the floors n until an egg breaks. starting from the first floor, the egg won't break, go to the 2nd floor and so on. Loop from the bottom floor to the top. When the egg breaks you have the critical floor. The runtime complexity would be O(n).
